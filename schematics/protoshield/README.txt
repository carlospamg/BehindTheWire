The initial prototyping shield was designed to be electrically similar to the original
BTW circuit. The same Arduino Uno pins were used, and the schematic can be considered
to be the same with the following exceptions:

  - Pull up resistors in original were XXXohms, 1.2kohms in shield
  - Diode in original was XXXX, shield has XXX.
