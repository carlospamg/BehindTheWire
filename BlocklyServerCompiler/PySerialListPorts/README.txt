As original target computers for this application were limited in the number
of packages that could have installed, we have included this package
together with the "Blockliduino for Behind the Wire" BlocklyServerCompiler
Python package. Only the required functionality to detect available COM
Ports has been left.

These modules have been extracted and modified from the pyserial package
version 2.7 :
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial


Pyserial license: TBD


List of Changes:
   TBD.
