## Behind the Wire Arduino Library

This is the Behind the Wire library for Arduino. This library needs to be copied to the IDE folder in order to be able to use the BehindTheWire class with the Arduino code.


### Install the library
To install the library copy the entire "behindthewire" folder to your Arduino libraries folder.

This folder is located in the Arduino IDE installation folder.


### Files
The directory structure should look like the following:

<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\BehindTheWire.h 
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\BehindTheWire.cpp
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\keywords.txt
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\examples\BlankTemplate\BlankTemplate.ino
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\examples\EngineSpeed\EngineSpeed.ino
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\examples\FoggyDayTakeoff\FoggyDayTakeoff.ino
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\examples\LandingGear\LandingGearSequence.ino
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\examples\PassengerReadingLight\PassengerReadingLight.ino
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\examples\RudderControl\RudderControl.ino
<Arduino installation folder>\libraries\behindthewire\examples\TestHardware\TestHardware.ino


#### BehindTheWire.h/.cpp
Contains the definitions of the inputs and outputs connected on the BtW box and class functions.

#### keywords.txt
Contains the keywords used by the btw library to allow correct syntax highlighting.

#### \examples\
Contains the source code for the exercises as written on the worksheets.
